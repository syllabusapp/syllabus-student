# Rafters
#### Stupid simple template builder

Rafters aims to be simple in that it does one thing well: help you build basic HTML, CSS and JS templates for a website or web application. It is built on top of gulp and uses several other open source plugins as dependencies.

To get started, simply run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, run `gulp` to start the dev/preview server. Final static files are spit out into the `build` folder.
