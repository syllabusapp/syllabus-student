        <li className="message message--received">You can chat with your teacher at any time and they will get the notification that a message is waiting on them the next time they long it.</li>
        <li className="message message--sent">Oh! Wow. That's pretty sweet. Will I bug her by messaging her too much?</li>
        <li className="message message--received">Your teacher will actually prefer to discuss things with you through chat as it doesn't fill up her email inbox. üòÅ &nbsp;So no need to worry about bugging your teachers.</li>
        <li className="message message--received">They will love talking with you through chat just as much as you enjoy it.</li>

          There are two reasons I believe Syllabus will make headway in the online higher education space. The first reason pertains to in-browser capabilities. I get to complete all my schoolwork for my degree without having to download a single piece of software, PDF or other file. The second reason pertains to the enjoyment of using Syllabus. I'm not confused at all as to what's due and when. Idon't feel like I'll ever be late on an assignment.

        <li className="message message--received">You'll still get the opportunity to finish the assignment, but be aware that you might get some points deducted if I so choose.</li>
        <li className="message message--received">With that said, please keep in mind that I'll be understanding if a late assignment is unavoidable due to personal reasons.</li>
        <li className="message message--sent">Oh! Okay, that's great! I'm certainly not planning on being late on any assignments. I just like to be aware of all that could possibly happen.</li>
        <li className="message message--received">Certainly! Now, if you do plan on being out for a vacation, for example, you can simply notify me that you will be absent by clicking on the link in the bottom right of the course dashboard.</li>
        <li className="message message--received">The sooner you let me know that you will be absent, the higher chance you will have of not having any points deducted.</li>
